# Long story short if you create file paths for a react app and deploy it on netlify you will need to create a `_redirects` file like this 
# one and place it in the root of your public folder and include : /* /index.html 200


# Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve
/* /index.html 200


# Other examples:
# / / 200
# /picture /picture  
# /gallery /gallery
# /profile /profile 
# /calendar /calendar
# /about /about
